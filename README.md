Random Audio File Player for AllStarLink version 3

This is derived from the Random Audio file player script file that Tony Morris created from his GMRSLive page. This one works great with ASL 3. Here is the origianl video for the HamVoIP version and the process is practially the same. 

Use this video for a Reference for now.
